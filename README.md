# secure-proxy

The major component of this exemplary setup was Keycloak Gatekeeper, of which development is discontinued: [sunsetting Keycloak Gatekeeper](https://www.keycloak.org/2020/08/sunsetting-louketo-project.adoc)

[OAuth2 Proxy](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/) is suggested, to be used instead, by the cited article. So a new showcase can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jumpingElephant/traefik-oauth2proxy-keycloak) in another repository.
